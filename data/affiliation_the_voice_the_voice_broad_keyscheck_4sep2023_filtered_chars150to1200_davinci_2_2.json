It wasn't always this way, but we course-corrected. After the Second World War, Liberal prime ministers Robert Menzies and Harold Holt began dismantling the White Australia policy, and in 1967 Harold Holt oversaw the successful referendum where Australians voted overwhelmingly to amend the Constitution to include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the census and allow the Commonwealth to make laws for them. It was another great step towards equality, which finally came in 1984 when voting became compulsory for Indigenous Australians. But this referendum on the Voice will undermine our equality of citizenship. It's an overcorrection. The Voice will embed new procedural rights in our Constitution\u2014rights which are conferred only on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice.

The Nationals believe that the Voice undermines our robust, genuine liberal democratic values, values which we will always support and which have helped make our country the best in the world. Crucially, a core component that underpins our free, liberal, democratic society in Australia is the fundamental principle that every citizen is considered equal under the law. A constitutionally enshrined advisory body to parliament based solely on a person's race does not align with this. This is about making sure we come back to one principle, one tenet: we're all equal. There are 227 voices here in the Australian parliament representing all 26 million Australians, no matter their colour, no matter their creed, no matter their religion. We take that seriously. I'm proud of the fact that this nation has elected 11 Indigenous Australians not just to represent Indigenous Australians but to represent all Australians. It's for these reasons the Nationals will, therefore, be opposing this bill.",

It does not acknowledge the rich 65,000 years of culture, arts and languages, or their songlines or Dreamtime.

Both of the major parties support seeing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians recognised in the Constitution. I suspect an overwhelming majority of Australians feel the same way. But the Prime Minister's being tricky here. He's seeking to conflate two separate issues: (1) constitutional recognition and (2) enshrining the Voice in the Constitution. He wants to leverage the overwhelming public support for constitutional recognition to piggyback his poorly defined, untested and risk ridden Canberra Voice model. And isn't it telling that in the 'yes' campaign's first video, the advertisement mentions recognition, but it fails to mention the Voice even once.",

I approached the Joint Select Committee on the Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples as somebody who was interested in constitutional law, but I realised how little I actually knew about Indigenous policy and Indigenous history and how much more I needed to know and wanted to know. The member for Indi has a particular interest in the whole issue of Closing the Gap and asked many questions about that issue. I'm going to write something, at greater leisure later in the year, about the experience of that committee and some of the things that we saw. But it occurred to me that it is occasionally good to admit that you don't have all the answers and that you can look around and there is much that you can learn from others.",

It cannot veto parliament but rather it provides greater input into the policy-making process which should lead to policy improvements and greater buy-in from Indigenous people across Australia. It is important that, if the parliament is going to make laws about Indigenous people, Indigenous people should be consulted about those laws. There is nothing incongruent about articulation of that rule of the Constitution. The Constitution is where rules for parliament are set out. In my view, the proposal for an advisory body has real merit and sits most comfortably with the nature of the Constitution. It is the kind of machinery clause that Griffith, Barton and their colleagues might have drafted, had they turned their minds to it.'",

In his desperation, the Leader of the Opposition is now seeking to amplify this misinformation and all of its catastrophising and contradictions: those exhausted cliches of Orwell and identity politics, and the ongoing conceit that there is apparently no inequality in Australia now, no legacy of discrimination, no disadvantage to address and no gap to close. That logic suggests, of course, that there is no need for a minister for Indigenous affairs\u2014job done! This is the same Leader of the Opposition who says that he boycotted the national apology because he thought it was just symbolism and wouldn't make a practical difference. Now he's leading a campaign against constitutional recognition through a voice, saying that he only wants symbolism, not something that will make a practical difference.",

His magnificent moustachioed visage is visible from the Footscray train station to everyone commuting into the CBD. William Cooper wasn't just a trade unionist; he wasn't just a pastor. He was an advocate before his time. His ideas were before their time. In the 1930s he called for land rights, but he also called for direct representation of Indigenous voices representing Indigenous peoples in Parliament House\u2014in the 1930s. He included that in a petition to the Prime Minister and later to the King. And we can clearly see the echoes in that petition\u2014that desire for an Indigenous voice, a First Nations voice in our Constitution, in our parliament\u2014in William Cooper's advocacy in the 1930s.",

Labor is fully supportive, as the member for Berowra, who is in the Chamber, knows. I know of his involvement with and support for the Uluru statement, and I acknowledge that. The Uluru statement contains three things. The first is an enshrined voice in the Constitution. Labor have made a commitment that we will have a referendum towards that goal in our first term of government. The other thing is the establishment of a makarrata commission, which has two incredibly complex, lengthy and expensive things to do. They are a national process of truth-telling and a national process of agreement and treaty. Neither of those things are easy, but Labor is putting meat on the bones of what they might look like, what they might cost and how we might take them forward. I want to make it very, very clear that a voice to the parliament, in whatever form it takes, does not mean that we cannot proceed on the other parts of the Uluru statement.",

It is about recognition and consultation: recognition that there is 65,000 years of shared history and continuous, unbroken connection to this land by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians; and consultation through a voice while listening to communities, delivering better policies and better outcomes as a result.",

What the Liberals miss is that the voices of charities bring a lived experience to public policy debates. Public policy debates are enriched through the voices of charities. That's why Labor's spoken out against gag clauses in social service agreements.

We must ensure that we are not sidetracked in the measured steps we take as a nation towards constitutional recognition of the Voice and that it is not allowed to be compromised by conflation with other constitutional concerns. It is overdue. It's a priority, and it demands a clear run to success. If we're to be truly one and free, this is part of that long and patient journey. Just as the young Queen's coronation was a turning point for hope, this is another.",

The history of the debate around constitutional recognition points to two significant problems with this suggestion.

That preamble proposal would have recognised, among other things, the special place of First Nations people 'for their deep kinship with their lands and for their ancient and continuing cultures'.

They, too, died for their country. We must remember them just as we remember those who fought more recent conflicts. It must all be a part of our reckoning with the truth.

We have the Greens political party in disarray, with former Greens Senator Thorpe backing the Nationals alongside Senator Price, while, sadly, in Queensland, we hear nothing but crickets from the Greens representatives. Thankfully, Senator Hanson-Young had the courage to support her community and came out in support of a 'yes' vote.

The First Nations National Constitutional Convention in 2017 saw Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people come together from all over Australia over four days to produce the Uluru Statement from the Heart. The Statement from the Heart represented First Nations Australians speaking with one voice in unity about being listened to and respected by non-Indigenous Australians and government about their future and recognising and paying respect to their unique culture and heritage.

Some have concerns about the inclusion of the executive being too broad. But the reality is that ministers develop policies, and public servants implement them. They are the executive. It's not just the passing of laws that requires input but the development and implementation of laws too. The Voice won't necessarily have an adversarial role with government, although it can hold government to account. The executive arm is likely to seek its advice to develop policy that actually works, and to work out how best implement it. This is completely in the interests of executive government and the country.

The rub here, everyone, is that Minister Wyatt\u2014whom I have enormous respect for\u2014made a statement several weeks ago at the Press Club, only to have what I think was the Prime Minister's office coming in over the top and saying there will be no enshrined voice in the Constitution.

The evidence of this is in the continued lack of action by this government on the Uluru Statement from the Heart and constitutional recognition for First Australians people. Unfortunately, Australia has a shameful record of improving the living standards of our First Australians. Our First Nations Australians have a life expectancy of almost 10 years below that of non-Indigenous Australians. Rates of infant mortality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are much worse than for the rest of the population. In many health indicators, such as rates of diabetes, heart disease and preventable blindness, our First Australians suffer at rates above the general population. Aboriginal men remain the most incarcerated people in the world. Couple all of this with the shockingly high rates of youth suicide in Indigenous communities, the lack of employment, high rates of children living in out-of-home care and the continued discrimination faced by Aboriginal people, and you see why our First Australians are fed up with the lack of understanding and action from the government to fix the disadvantage.",

After all these years, what we're doing has failed First Nations people. It's not working. It is time.' Instead of talking about a reset on closing the gap, I think it's time for a reset on the original relationships between First Nations people and the remainder of the Australian nationhood. Self-determination shouldn't ever be just a theoretical concept; it needs to be set in practice. We should have that trusting relationship: both in ourselves as mature citizens, but also in our First Nations people and that they certainly do have the answers. And this is the complaint about deficit language: First Nations people have said, time and time again, 'You need us to be able to take control of our own lives and destinies.'",

This process of constitutional recognition has been a long journey. It is yet to arrive at a point, I think we can fairly say, where there is broad agreement as to what the proposition would be. Indeed, there is a large gap between where the opposition stands, on the form of this, and where the government stands. I would have thought there would need to be a real consensus to enable such a referendum to be successful, because what I'm interested in is that such a proposition would be successful. Success is the goal that I would seek in pursuing that agenda, and it's an agenda that I am pursuing and the Minister for Indigenous Australians is pursuing. One of the things I've learned carefully from the Minister for Indigenous Australians is you need to keep walking together until you can find the point where there is an agreement that would enable such an important recognition to be achieved.",

It is bitterly disappointing that the government has already rejected this proposal and has put forward the scandalous notion that somehow this would be a third chamber to the parliament. Of course, the very idea is never to challenge the sovereignty of this parliament in terms of a First Nations point. The government has claimed misleadingly that it will be a third chamber. That is certainly not the way in which it is being perceived.

It talked about a Makarrata Commission, which would lead the process of agreement and treaty making. It also talked about a national process of truth-telling.

He didn't specify that it had to be someone of First Nations descent; it was someone who understood the challenges of First Nations people. William Cooper, in 1937, asked for the very first voice to Australian parliament. At that time, the federal government denied William Cooper's request to send that petition to the royal family. Sadly, before William Cooper passed away, that petition was sidelined.

One was to seek to have a voice in this parliament\u2014that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would be consulted on the issues and policies that were directly impacting and affecting them and that they would have some mechanism to have a voice to parliament on those issues. Tragically, this was dismissed in circumstances that I think were grossly unfair. There were wildly inaccurate allegations at the time that this request for a voice to parliament was somehow the creation of a third chamber. We know this to be untrue. I think even those people who first thought that have subsequently acknowledged that that was not the case; I thank the member for New England for correcting the record and saying that he had got that wrong. Nonetheless, there was a lot of damage done. Within days, there was a complete rejection of the elements of the Uluru statement. These were issues that hurt deeply for a number of First Nations people.",

The Voice is advisory. It won't be Moses handing down tablets from the mountain. The parliament will still be the democratic centre of our national life. The parliament will still be supreme in matters of law and policy. The Voice will advise\u2014just like the security services, the Chief Medical Officer, the Chief Scientist, DFAT and other agencies advise. And it remains with the parliament and the executive to weigh that advice, to consider and reflect on it, and sometimes to reject it, because our duty is to consider the national perspective and the national interest. The same will apply to the local and regional voices. Advice will always be weighed. In fact, the words the amendment uses are 'make representations', a much more modest term than 'advice'. 'Advice' implies mandatory consideration, whereas 'representation' only implies receipt.",

When Australians go to the polls they will be asked to change the Constitution, to establish an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament. The Voice is about two things: recognition and consultation. Recognition of Australia's First Peoples in the nation's birth certificate, our Constitution\u2014something promised by successive governments over decades; and consultation, giving First Nations Australians a say in the policies that impact them. These are simple things but they're a huge step for our nation, and one that we really have such a great opportunity to take together this year at this referendum.",
