The tragedy is that this request, this plea for respect, has been ignored by the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments and their members of parliament. By dismissing the Uluru Statement from the Heart and, indeed, introducing legislation to extend the cashless welfare card, they are doing things to Aboriginal people, not doing things with them. That is a paternalistic, almost a colonial, approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people relations—implementing this through expanding policies that continue to tell Aboriginal people what is good for them, rather than listening and working with those people.",

Our First Nations people have been patient in their advocacy, telling us that all the above models designed to improve their situation failed in part because they were designed from the top down, rather than the bottom up. That's why their direct Voice to parliamentarians like us is so important. The government says the referendum is a matter of principle—true, but it's about more than that.

So I ask the people in here who are not on board yet, who think this somehow makes our country a worse place to be, to rethink and to listen to the voices of the Aboriginal people. It is time for them to be recognised in our constitution. It is time for them to have a meaningful voice in this place. It's time for our country to go through the process of truth-telling and treaty-making so that we emerge as a stronger, fairer country on the other side of that process.",

He was critical of the model that was put up by the Constitutional Convention, which favoured a president elected by the parliament as opposed to a popularly elected president. I also got to know him through discussions we had about the law over the years. As conference convener of the Samuel Griffith Society, I invited Bob to give his thoughts on Indigenous constitutional recognition. It's fair to say he would have adopted a much more radical proposal than I or other members of the society would have been comfortable with. He was a much-sought-after after-dinner speaker given his long experience in the law and public affairs. He embodied the living history of our country. In more recent years, I've spoken to Bob about issues dealing with Indigenous recognition. Only a few weeks before his death, he sent me a long paper he'd written about the Makarrata and the Uluru statement more broadly. I'm honoured to follow in his footsteps as shadow minister for Indigenous Australians.",

It is about acknowledging that something has been done wrong and seeking to make things right. What a wonderful concept. The committee acknowledges that the word 'makarrata' means different things to different people. The Referendum Council says that 'makarrata' is another word for treaty or agreement-making; however, the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council calls it both truth-telling and agreement-making.

I want to begin by again acknowledging as we do each morning when we open in this place the traditional owners of the land on which we meet, land which was never ceded. What a privilege it has been for me to grow up on your country, to live and work and raise my own family on your country. I want to acknowledge the elders of this area. I respect their deep, significant cultural connection to this country that has existed for over 65,000 years, the oldest continuing culture on the planet.",

I believe that it's time we asked the Australian people to make this change to our Constitution. This change will be both symbolic and practical. It will right a 122-year-old wrong. When it was written, our Constitution had two references to First Nations people and they were both negative. First Nations people were not to be included in the census, and no laws were to be made for their benefit. The 1967 referendum was a good first step, including Indigenous people in the census, and, in 1992, Mabo was a good second step, recognising their relationship with land. It's now time to be honest with ourselves about history, through constitutional recognition. It's time to commit to listening so we can develop policies that work and level the playing field for First Nations people over the next generation.",

It is simply a request from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that they be consulted about decisions that affect them.

As I've said many times on radio, on TV, at market stalls and in addresses to youth leadership delegations, with First Nations audiences and immigrant audiences alike, Constitutional recognition through a voice is about two things. It is about recognition and consultation: recognition that there is 65,000 years of shared history and continuous, unbroken connection to this land by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians; and consultation through a voice while listening to communities, delivering better policies and better outcomes as a result.",

Joining each dialogue were a representative sample of approximately 100 First Nations people drawn from local traditional custodians, Indigenous community based organisations and Indigenous leaders. These regional dialogues selected their own representatives to attend the First Nations National Constitutional Convention at Uluru. At the convention, and by an overwhelming consensus, more than 250 delegates adopted the Uluru statement.

Many of the recommendations from the 1987 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody have not been implemented. Since the conclusion of the royal commission in 1991, 432 Aboriginal people have died in custody without any person being convicted. I express my deepest sympathy to the many families who have suffered through this traumatic experience. The system has failed you. The Uluru Statement from the Heart states that Indigenous people are not innately criminal people. Yet today Indigenous people represent two per cent of the total population, 28 per cent of the prison population, 34 per cent of incarcerated women and 48 per cent of juveniles in custody. Since 2004, the number of Indigenous people incarcerated has increased by 88 per cent, while the number of non-Aboriginal people incarcerated has increased by 28 per cent.

In his desperation, the Leader of the Opposition is now seeking to amplify this misinformation and all of its catastrophising and contradictions: those exhausted cliches of Orwell and identity politics, and the ongoing conceit that there is apparently no inequality in Australia now, no legacy of discrimination, no disadvantage to address and no gap to close. That logic suggests, of course, that there is no need for a minister for Indigenous affairs—job done! This is the same Leader of the Opposition who says that he boycotted the national apology because he thought it was just symbolism and wouldn't make a practical difference. Now he's leading a campaign against constitutional recognition through a voice, saying that he only wants symbolism, not something that will make a practical difference.",

I spoke recently at the War Memorial about those Indigenous Australians who donned the khaki and fought for a nation that was not prepared to fight for them. They fought for a continent for which their own people had fought during the frontier wars, wars we have not yet learnt to speak of so loudly. They, too, died for their loved ones. They, too, died for their country. We must remember them just as we remember those who fought more recent conflicts. It must all be a part of our reckoning with the truth. Without it, we cannot be whole. 'Makarrata', that powerful Yolngu word, means coming together after a conflict.

It was pretty sad because there was a leader who didn't have the fortitude to take this issue and, basically, have the debate and advocate for this very important issue. Eighty per cent of the respondents had said very clearly that a First Nations voice was required. Those opposite obviously got rid of that Prime Minister anyway. Despite slamming the door on what the Uluru Statement from the Heart actually called for, the government has engaged in a consultative process on the design of an Indigenous voice. We're currently in the midst of that process.",

We're all equal before the law, and all have the same liberties, whether you're an Indigenous Australian, you're Australian born or you have come from around the world and become an Australian citizen. It wasn't always this way, but we course-corrected. After the Second World War, Liberal prime ministers Robert Menzies and Harold Holt began dismantling the White Australia policy, and in 1967 Harold Holt oversaw the successful referendum where Australians voted overwhelmingly to amend the Constitution to include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the census and allow the Commonwealth to make laws for them. It was another great step towards equality, which finally came in 1984 when voting became compulsory for Indigenous Australians. But this referendum on the Voice will undermine our equality of citizenship. It's an overcorrection. The Voice will embed new procedural rights in our Constitution—rights which are conferred only on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. It will have an Orwellian effect, where all Australians are equal but some Australians are more equal than others.",

The Uluru statement contains three things. The first is an enshrined voice in the Constitution. Labor have made a commitment that we will have a referendum towards that goal in our first term of government. The other thing is the establishment of a makarrata commission, which has two incredibly complex, lengthy and expensive things to do. They are a national process of truth-telling and a national process of agreement and treaty. Neither of those things are easy, but Labor is putting meat on the bones of what they might look like, what they might cost and how we might take them forward.

After all these years, what we're doing has failed First Nations people. It's not working. It is time.' Instead of talking about a reset on closing the gap, I think it's time for a reset on the original relationships between First Nations people and the remainder of the Australian nationhood. Self-determination shouldn't ever be just a theoretical concept; it needs to be set in practice. We should have that trusting relationship: both in ourselves as mature citizens, but also in our First Nations people and that they certainly do have the answers. And this is the complaint about deficit language: First Nations people have said, time and time again, 'You need us to be able to take control of our own lives and destinies.'",

It's a call for all of us to be a voice for reconciliation—in intangible ways in our everyday lives—because the defining moments of our history have been when ordinary Australians have put their shoulder to the wheel of history and pushed it forward, and in doing so made Australia a better place: the 1938 Day of Mourning, the '67 referendum, Wave Hill, Mabo, the Apology to the Stolen Generations, the 1997 Reconciliation Convention, the walks over bridges, the Redfern speech and, of course, the Uluru Statement from the Heart.",

This process of constitutional recognition has been a long journey. It is yet to arrive at a point, I think we can fairly say, where there is broad agreement as to what the proposition would be. Indeed, there is a large gap between where the opposition stands, on the form of this, and where the government stands. I would have thought there would need to be a real consensus to enable such a referendum to be successful, because what I'm interested in is that such a proposition would be successful. Success is the goal that I would seek in pursuing that agenda, and it's an agenda that I am pursuing and the Minister for Indigenous Australians is pursuing. One of the things I've learned carefully from the Minister for Indigenous Australians is you need to keep walking together until you can find the point where there is an agreement that would enable such an important recognition to be achieved.",

The Voice is advisory. It won't be Moses handing down tablets from the mountain. The parliament will still be the democratic centre of our national life. The parliament will still be supreme in matters of law and policy. The Voice will advise—just like the security services, the Chief Medical Officer, the Chief Scientist, DFAT and other agencies advise. And it remains with the parliament and the executive to weigh that advice, to consider and reflect on it, and sometimes to reject it, because our duty is to consider the national perspective and the national interest. The same will apply to the local and regional voices. Advice will always be weighed. In fact, the words the amendment uses are 'make representations', a much more modest term than 'advice'.

Ultimately, the form of the voice will emerge from the co-design process, but the lead point is that the voice will be designed with government but by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and adapted for local conditions right across the country. The voice will provide a mechanism for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to be consulted and engaged on the policies and laws that affect them. It will provide a forum for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to bring issues to government. Such a process has as its goals better social and economic policy outcomes for our First Nations people.",

I think there is actually a deeper and more important part of the redress scheme—that is, the opportunity for each survivor to confidentially tell their story about the impact of their removal to a senior official within government, and to have it acknowledged and receive a face-to-face written apology for the removal and resulting trauma. Too often in our country, people feel they are not being listened to by government and have nowhere to go to tell their story. So I think that this aspect is very important.

The history of a First Nations voice, and the idea of a voice to parliament, is one that predates that by many, many decades—in fact, by many, many generations. The person in Australia who first came up with the idea of a voice to parliament and really advocated for it on a national stage was William Cooper. William Cooper, in 1937, presented a petition, which he wanted to present to the royal family in England, that outlined calling for representation of First Nations people to the federal parliament. He didn't specify that it had to be someone of First Nations descent; it was someone who understood the challenges of First Nations people. William Cooper, in 1937, asked for the very first voice to Australian parliament. At that time, the federal government denied William Cooper's request to send that petition to the royal family. Sadly, before William Cooper passed away, that petition was sidelined. But William Cooper's grandkids saw the formal presentation of his petition to the royal family, to the Queen, only a few years ago.",

We talked about what the old ATSIC looked like and regional councils and regional assemblies and how their voice might be properly articulated at a community and regional level. They made it clear that was their aspiration. Sadly, and this is just a comment, in many places people hadn't even heard of the Statement from the Heart. The aspirations of people who live in very rural communities are sometimes not heard. The thing we need to understand is we need to go talk to them wherever they might be—in the remotest corners of this country. It's all right to have the voices of Sydney and Melbourne, because they can get a hold of the media. That's fine. There's no doubt they have a very legitimate cause to prosecute. But we need to make sure that the interests we're representing are the interests of all First Nations people, not just some. That requires us to do the listening that is properly done.",

A voice to parliament enshrined in the constitution is backed by cultural authority. Politicians didn't come up with a voice. Over 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives issued the Statement from the Heart, calling for a voice to parliament. Years of work and consultation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people led to the Uluru statement, and continued consultation has followed from it.

The Uluru statement calls too for treaty as a process of agreement-making and truth-telling—and I support that too—and a voice will enable that process to follow.",

The first problem with the idea of symbolic recognition through a constitutional preamble is it has previously been rejected by Australians at a referendum on 6 November 1999. That preamble proposal would have recognised, among other things, the special place of First Nations people 'for their deep kinship with their lands and for their ancient and continuing cultures'. Fewer than 40 per cent of voters nationwide said 'yes' to the preamble and it failed to achieve majority support in any state or territory.",

It was right up there with my first day in parliament, when the member for Dickson walked out on the apology to the stolen generations. Today, the Nationals stood as one and said no to a voice to parliament for First Nations people. The Leader of the Nationals has the hide to stand up and say that they believe in empowering local Indigenous communities, when they did nothing for the 10 years they were in government. This is a party whose former leader proclaimed after the Wik decision that they would make laws to extinguish native title as much as they could. When they were in government they forced people in remote communities onto the cashless debit card. How is this empowering them?",

It talked about a Makarrata Commission, which would lead the process of agreement and treaty making. It also talked about a national process of truth-telling. There are several questions I wish to put to the minister in relation to that particular process and where things are at in relation to the co-design process. It seems to me that the Labor Party has been very forthright in saying to the government on this particular issue: 'We want to work with you. We want to collaborate.'

It is important that, if the parliament is going to make laws about Indigenous people, Indigenous people should be consulted about those laws.

Cooper drafted a petition to King George VI, signed by thousands, asking for this Indigenous representation in this parliament, only for the Prime Minister at the time, Joseph Lyons, to reject it out of hand and refuse to pass it on to the monarch. We clearly hear the echo of that moment in the Uluru Statement from the Heart and the current government's response to it. The fact that the substance of William Cooper's petition 80 years ago is so similar to the substance of the Uluru Statement from the Heart is telling.",
